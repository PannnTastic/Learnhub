    console.log('Form data received:', req.body);
    console.log('File uploaded:', req.file);
    // ... rest of code
});
```

### **2. Check Error Messages**
Look for flash messages or error responses

### **3. Test with Minimal Data**
Try submitting form with only required fields:

- Description  
- Category
- Level

### **4. Check Route Registration**
Verify routes are properly registered in `app.js`
